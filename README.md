## A 2D mobile app game

A tree climbing branch swinging game evolved into what become a ninja skyscraper climbing game. Dodge owls and time your swings just right to make it as high as you can go, beyond the skyscrapers, sky lanterns, and fireworks!

Solar 2D was used to build the Android Application Bundles. The project was written in the language of Solar 2D, namely Lua. All UI elements and models were created by myself using Figma.
